```{r}
# Turn off scientific notation

# Load the tidyverse.

library(lubridate)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
homicide_dataset <- read_csv("homicide-data.csv")
```
```{r}
homicide_dataset$reported_date <- year(homicide_dataset$reported_date)
   
```
We cleaned up the reported_date column and got rid of the day and month
Then we filtered by years 2014 and 2017 to see the "recent years" of the dataset. We focus on the cities and those years and the amount of homicides in each of those cities. Then we aggange by each given year for every city and count the decrease or increase in homicides. 

```{r}
homicide_dataset_2014_to_2017 <- homicide_dataset  %>%
filter (reported_date == "2014" | reported_date == "2017") %>%
group_by (city, reported_date)%>%
 summarize(count=n())%>% 
group_by(city) %>% 
  arrange(city, reported_date, .by_group = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(delta = count - lag(count))
```
Here we use that dataset for 2014 and 2017 and count how many cities experienced decrease and increase in homicides. Turns out Chicago was one of 25 cities that saw an increase in those years. WP claimed it was among 30 cities, but some data might for certain cities might have been missing from their dataset.(?)
```{r}
homicide_dataset_2014_to_2017%>%
mutate(
    cities_change = case_when(
      delta < 0 ~ 'decrease',
      delta > 0 ~ 'increase'
    )
  )%>%
group_by(cities_change)%>%
  summarize(count=n())

```
